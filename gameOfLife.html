  <h1>Conway's Game Of Life... The multiplayer experience!</h1>
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/">Conway's Game of life</a> is
    an experiment in cellular automation. I have already done some experiments by
    making a <a href="http://gameoflife.samuellevy.com/">3D HTML5 implementation</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This time, I've decided to make a 2D version, but one that everyone can enjoy
    together! This version lives on a server, and so what you see, everyone else
    viewing also sees. It also means that what you add, everyone else sees.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Rules:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
      <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
      <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
      <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
    </ul>

    Please wait...

    This was a fun experiment, created by <a href="http://www.samuellevy.com/">Samuel Levy</a>.
    You can get the source code on <a href="https://github.com/samlev/SharedGameOfLife">Git Hub</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I used <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> to build this.
